5,31-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Love my Echo!,1
5,31-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Loved it!,1
4,31-Jul-18,Walnut Finish ,"Sometimes while playing a game, you can answer a question correctly but Alexa says you got it wrong and answers the same as you.  I like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home.",1
5,31-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"I have had a lot of fun with this thing. My 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs, i control the lights and play games like categories. Has nice sound when playing music as well.",1
5,31-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Music,1
5,31-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can?t wait to see what else it can do.",1
3,31-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,"Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet.",1
5,31-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,looks great,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"Love it! I?ve listened to songs I haven?t heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It?s great!",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times,1
5,30-Jul-18,Oak Finish ,"I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Love, Love, Love!!",1
5,30-Jul-18,Oak Finish ,Just what I expected....,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"I love it, wife hates it.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound,1
4,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying.",1
4,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it?s not intrusive to look at.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask,1
3,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,"I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,Amazing product,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"I love my Echo. It's easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised. I use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test Alexa's knowledge.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Sounds great!! Love them!,1
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Just like the other one,1
5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good,1
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I like it,1
5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,"She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa ?learn? Tasha?s birthday.  Or Alexa ?learn? my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great",1
3,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,This device is awesome!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,"Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn?t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube.",1
4,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running.",1
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,So far so good,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,Great,1
5,30-Jul-18,Walnut Finish ,Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.,1
2,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals.",0
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,I love you so much,1
3,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify ?plus/prime/etc? account.  So you must pay to play ?your? music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is ???? .,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en espa¤ol.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"I'm still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great! The sound is actually much better than I was expecting.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Works as you?d expect and then some. Also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.,1
3,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,like google better,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Works as advertised. Very easy to setup. Still learning what this can do.,1
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Great sound and easy to set up.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Oak Finish ,"Love Alexa, bought others for friends",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,??,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Love being able to listen to music easily. Still learning all the features available,1
4,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"Did t really know what I could use this device for. Used it for a few things, but need an overview",1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Love this just wish it had a built in hub,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,How easy if was to set up.,1
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,You?re all I need...na na nana!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Does everything as expected and more.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,"I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Great sound in a small package?easy to set up and use; fun to own.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Works and sounds great.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,The sound is amazing and many collections of all music,1
4,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,Setting up,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,She doesn?t always listen,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,It?s awesome,1
4,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I?m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many ?apps? you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I?m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I LIKE IT ALL,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I love it. It does everything,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I'm not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! I'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!,1
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I like it and still learning how to use it.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Great technology!! Can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation), It was a no-brainer.  Best gift ever!",1
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Works fine!!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric , ,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Clear music,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Fun to use, good sound quality",1
5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Works great, but I don't think Amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) Have Prime AND 2) Buy an Echo.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,The speaker sounds really good,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Good sound works well,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,"Love the Echo !!! I love the size, material and speaker quality. I have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat. Next is Echo Dot for bedroom. There is a lot more to do with Echo that you think. Traffic, Weather, Trivia, etc.",1
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Love it!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,The entire family loves Alexa Echo. She?s now a part of this family.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Walnut Finish ,"Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren,who also have an Echo, is a HUGE bonus.  Can't wait to learn more and more and more",1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Love it!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"awesome thing, love Alexa",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,It worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound. It is perfect for my classroom!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"LOVE, LOVE this new little gadget.  Has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  We hardly need our CD's anymore, since ALEXA plays everything we need.  Going to get the Alexa DOTS soon for more rooms.  Thanks!!",1
4,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,The speaker is of surprising quality. Happy with the purchase.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,I'm really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it's coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.,1
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"It?s still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don?t get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it?s great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it?s even better.",1
4,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.,1
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Great device, responsive and helpful",1
2,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose,0
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.,1
4,30-Jul-18,Oak Finish ,"4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn?t be happier!",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,It's Alexa.... what else can you say,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Upgraded from my lilttle echo dot. Happy with sound,1
4,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,"Excellent product, set up with ease as well.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,I've had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I'm happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,wonderful product and fast delivery!,1
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Initially harder to set up called tech wasn?t that knowledgeable now working great.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,It was very easy to set up and my family love it?s!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,How did I live this long without the Echo . You get to enjoy any music style  just my asking Alexa . Going to up-greade to the wireless . Love the Echo . Love you too Alexa .,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I?m across the room or busy doing something else.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Love our echo,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"I love it,she is very helpful. I use her for remembering things and sleep. You can ask her just about anything. I have only had her for about a week so still learning her.",1
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I love having an Alexa!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,So far I like it ??,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Still love it,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Love it,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"I love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound.",1
4,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"I have had for only a week, so I am still learning all that Alexa can do.  It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don?t have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try ?dropping in?.on my son when he gets home.  Going to surprise him.",1
1,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Not much features.,0
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Great sound quality, great features, great product. Multi room music is very cool.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Cool,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.,1
3,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn't be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.,1
3,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,Love it,1
5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,awesome.understands my kids,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,We were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT, I really love having the music.",1
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my ""smart"" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!",1
5,30-Jul-18,Oak Finish ,Versatile and fun !!!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Works great! Killer speaker! My wife and son love it.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Walnut Finish ,We regret waiting so long to purchase this item. We are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.,1
1,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,"Stopped working after 2 weeks ,didn't follow commands!? Really fun when it was working?",0
5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app,1
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.

5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her ?no? for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It?s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you?re going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou?ll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn?t live without.",1

2,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa.",0
3,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.,1
5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Everything,1
3,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,I like the interaction of asking questions. I don?t like that I can?t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.,1
5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.,1
5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!,1
